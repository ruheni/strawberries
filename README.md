**About this project:**
Wtehim is the word for wild strawberries in Lenape, the language of the people who originally lived in my home of New York City. In this project I'm designing and building a seed store focused on plants native to the Northeast of the United States. You can also use the site to learn the Lenape names for the plants.

**Learning goals:**

- Deepen my fluency with React
- Build a project with Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- Learn to use Postgres + Prisma
- Implement user authentication + a shopping cart
- Design a visually polished fullstack app
  - Add custom search bars by flower color
  - Continue to work on good UI practices, accessibility, + responsive web design

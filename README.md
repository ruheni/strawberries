**About this project:**
I'm designing and building a seed store focused on plants native to the Northeast of the United States. You can also use the site to learn the Lenape names for the plants.

**Learning goals:**

- Deepen my fluency with React
- Build a project with Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- Learn to use Postgres + Prisma
- Implement user authentication + a shopping cart
- Design a visually polished fullstack app
  - Add custom search bars by flower color
  - Continue to work on good UI practices, accessibility, + responsive web design
